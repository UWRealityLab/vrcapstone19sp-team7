## Code Update
* The team logged many hours of debugging this week! The code for the bass puzzle and polished versions of the other sections is in much better shape now. Teleporting is now smoother and not button-dependent.

* [Bass Puzzle](https://github.com/UWRealityLab/vrcapstone19sp-team7/tree/master/PhantasiaConductor/Assets/Scripts/RadialPuzzle)
* [Better UI](https://github.com/UWRealityLab/vrcapstone19sp-team7/tree/master/PhantasiaConductor/Assets/Scripts/UI)


## Idea Update
* We removed the puzzle based on a throwing mechanic (too troublesome and was not generalizing well for a variety of users) and added a bass puzzle based on catching spheres

* We have begun successfully incorporating the chosen theme song from *How to Train Your Dragon*

* The puzzles now have guidance messages and arrows indicating the next place to explore

* Our official name is Cosmic Symphony!

## Blocking Issues
* Audio syncing with an actual music piece is even more challenging than just with simple midi instrument files, which has complicated our workflow slightly
* Designing a cross-platform project has come with some unique challenges that we are tackling by trying to reference more generalized prefabs/scripts that then take care of proper package assignment (OVR versus SteamVR)
