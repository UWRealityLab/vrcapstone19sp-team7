title: Week 8
---

## What Everyone Did
* A.J: Debugged removing SteamVR from the Oculus version of the project, since it kept regenerating itself, and began fully transferring the project over to work on the Quest. Added a few assets for better game guidance, like animated arrows.

* P.J: Added new bass puzzle

* Ben:  Continued creating audio files, added harmony motion, fixed random bugs everywhere, added Destroyer

* Hannah: DELETED DESTROYER, transition between puzzles and fantasia, fanasia controller and ability to time events, fix
harmony bug, add visual guides/hints 


## Code Update
* The team logged many hours of debugging this week! The code for the bass puzzle and polished versions of the other sections is in much better shape now. Teleporting is now smoother and not button-dependent.

* [Better UI](https://github.com/UWRealityLab/vrcapstone19sp-team7/tree/master/PhantasiaConductor/Assets/Scripts/UI)


## Idea Update
* We removed the puzzle based on a throwing mechanic (too troublesome and was not generalizing well for a variety of users) and added a bass puzzle based on catching spheres

* We have begun successfully incorporating the chosen theme song from *How to Train Your Dragon*

* The puzzles now have guidance messages and arrows indicating the next place to explore

* Our official name is Cosmic Symphony!

## Plan for Next Week

* Have the main theme song fully synced to the puzzles 
* Finish the video 
* Smooth out mechanics of puzzles and add more guidance/prompts to reduce confusion

Here is what everyone will do:

P.J: 
* Set up basic melody puzzle
* Polish and debug
* Implement more game effects

Ben:
* Polish and tweak various existing game elements based on demo feedback from staff (percussion puzzle, harmony puzzle)
* Add progress indicator for players
* Make full song audio

A.J:
* Continue transferring project over to Oculus Quest (change scripts, safety check to ensure gameplay is close to identical).
* Have a working copy on the Quest headset by the end of this week.

Hannah:
* Build up and polish the finale "fantasia moment"
* Polish gameflow and debug as needed


## Blocking Issues
* Debugging compiled scene errors as we combine all the game elements together is nontrivial, to say the least (We had a Destroyer object that ended up going rogue and it took us a long time to figure ou why everything was suddenly being deleted)
* Building our project into a compact, smooth executable has raised more errors than we anticipated
