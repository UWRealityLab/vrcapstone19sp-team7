title: Week 7
---

## What Everyone Did
* A.J: Explored feasibility of transferring the project over to the Oculus Quest and discussed her findings with the team. Forked the team repo and began fully implementing Quest compatibility.
* P.J: PJ worked on smooth gameflow, adding a fast-forward 'hot-key' for insurance.
* Ben: Worked on rhythm puzzle animation, throwing puzzle logistics, miscellaneous things in main scene
* Hannah: worked on polishing/smoothertransitions (chaning hands for each puzle, making teleport indicator pulse, etc). Worked on smoothing throwing mechanics to no avail :) 

## Code Update
We continued to compile everything into a main scene and smooth gameplay arc, debugging all of the minor issues that arose. Hannah and Ben continued to troubleshoot the throwing game section and trialled different physics-based mechanisms.

## Idea Update
* We decided on an overall unifying song! The main theme from the film [*How to Train Your Dragon*](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=2C4lFUpI_4U)

Getting good feedback:

## Plan for Next Week
Add in the final song, reduce puzzle difficulty, and keep polishing!
* Easier version of throwing section
* Easier version of percussion section
* Have the main theme song synced to the puzzles 
* Smooth out mechanics of puzzles and add some guidance/prompts to reduce confusion

Here is what everyone will do:

P.J: 
* Add haptic feedback for puzzles
* Work on more effects (ex: music tempo changing during Fantasia, allow object collisions, etc)

Ben:
* Fix harmony puzzle eyeline tracking, export audio tracks for dragon song, add some kind of progress indicator

A.J:
* Continue transferring project over to Oculus Quest (change scripts, safety check to ensure gameplay is close to identical).  

Hannah:
* Add UI guidence prompts
* Figure out teleporting without pushing buttons

## Blocking Issues
* Figuring out the best way to scale down the difficulty of our puzzles will be a challenge. 
* Smoothing out throwing mechanics is still troublesome.
