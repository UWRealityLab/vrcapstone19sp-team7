This VR “Cosmic Symphony” experience combines movement, color, and sound to bring a new dimension to music. Players unlock each section of the orchestra by playing rhythm games that will deepen their understanding of how different parts of a musical composition fit together. The game is set in outer space, providing a whimsical and magical enviornment.
